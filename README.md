## Chapter 4 - Expresssions

### Simple Assignment

- In C programming, single assignment is an `operator`, not a `statement`.

```c
// Sample 1
int i, j, k;

i = j = k = 0; // same as i = (j = (k = 0));
// Result - i = 0, j = 0, k = 0

// Sample 2
int x, y, z;

x = 3;
// it works, but not an good idea‚àè
z = x + (y = x);

// Result - x = 3, y = 3, z = 6
```

- assignment operator requires an `lvalue` as its left operand.
- `LValue` represents an object stored in computer memory, not a constant or the result of a computation.

### Compound Assignment

- `v += e` is not exactly same as `v = v + e`

```c
// x *= (y + z);
// x = x * (y + z);
x *= y + z;

// x = (x * y) + z;
x = x * y + z;
```
